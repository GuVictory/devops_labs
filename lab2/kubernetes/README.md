# Kubernetes

-   **Description:** Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for running distributed systems.
-   **Purpose and Benefits:** Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure complexities. It ensures high availability, scalability, and resilience, making it ideal for running microservices-based architectures.
-   **Key Features and Functionalities:** Kubernetes offers container orchestration, automatic scaling, load balancing, service discovery, and self-healing capabilities. It provides declarative configuration through YAML files, allows rolling updates and rollbacks, and supports integration with container registries.
-   **Use Cases and Examples:** DevOps teams use Kubernetes to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. For example, an e-commerce company may use Kubernetes to deploy their web application, scale it based on demand, and ensure fault tolerance and high availability by automatically restarting failed containers.
