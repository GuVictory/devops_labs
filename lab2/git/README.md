# Git

-   **Description:** Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) widely used in software development. It allows teams to manage source code repositories, track changes, and collaborate on code effectively.
-   **Purpose and Benefits:** Git enables version control, branching, and merging of code, providing a reliable and efficient way to track and manage changes. It facilitates collaboration among team members, helps resolve conflicts, and ensures the integrity and traceability of code.
-   **Key Features and Functionalities:** Git provides features like branch management, commit history, merging, and tagging. It allows developers to work offline and independently on different branches and provides mechanisms for code review, collaboration, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Use Cases and Examples:** Development teams use Git for version control and collaborative code management. For instance, a team may use Git to track code changes, create branches for feature development, collaborate on code reviews, and merge changes back into the main codebase.
