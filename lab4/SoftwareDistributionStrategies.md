# Research Software Distribution Strategies

Software distribution refers to the process of delivering software applications and updates to end users. It is a critical part of the software release process that ensures users have access to the latest stable versions of applications. The main goals of software distribution are to make new software available quickly, efficiently, and securely.

## Common software distribution strategies include:

-   **Centralized distribution**: Software is hosted on a central server and users directly download and install it from there. This allows for easier centralized control and security. However, it can cause bandwidth issues if many users try to access it simultaneously.
-   **Peer-to-peer distribution**: Users download software from each other in a decentralized manner instead of a central server. This reduces bandwidth usage for the distributor but makes it harder to control the process.
-   **Package managers**: Pre-compiled software bundles are distributed through package manager tools like apt, yum, chocolatey etc. This automates software installation and updating process.
-   **App stores**: Mobile and desktop apps are distributed through curated app marketplaces like Play Store, App store etc. It provides centralized access but the process is controlled by store owners.
-   **On-premise distribution**: Software is manually installed by IT teams within an organization by deploying it on local servers/machines. Does not rely on the internet but scaling and updating can be challenging.

## Best practices for effective software distribution include:

-   Using secure protocols like HTTPS to prevent tampering
-   Code signing to validate authenticity of software
-   Testing distributions on staging environments first
-   Automating deployments using CI/CD pipelines
-   Slowly rolling out to subsets of users first to limit issues
-   Making software available through multiple regions/data centers for redundancy
-   Setting up robust monitoring of systems and user feedback
-   Maintaining integrity of software packages throughout the distribution process
-   Clearly communicating release notes, dependencies etc to users
-   Planning capacity and bandwidth to handle peak distribution loads
